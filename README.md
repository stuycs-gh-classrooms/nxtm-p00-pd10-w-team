This project will be completed in phases. The first phase will be to work on this document. Use github-flavoured markdown. (For more markdown help [click here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) )

All projects will require the following:
- Researching new forces to implement.
- Method for each new force, returning a `PVector`  -- similar to `getGravity` and `getSpring` (using whatever parameters are necessary).
- A distinct demonstration for each individual force (including gravity and the spring force).
- A visual menu at the top providing information about which simulation is currently active and indicating whether movement is on or off.
- The ability to toggle movement on/off
- The ability to toggle bouncing on/off
- The user should be able to switch _between_ simluations using the number keys as follows:
  - `1`: Gravity
  - `2`: Spring Force
  - `3`: Drag
  - `4`: Custom Force
  - `5`: Combination


## Phase 0: Force Selection, Analysis & Plan
---------- 

#### Custom Force: NAME OF YOUR FORCE

### Forumla
What is the formula for your force? Including descriptions/definitions for the symbols. (You may include a picture of the formula if it is not easily typed.)

YOUR ANSWER HERE

### Custom Force
- What information that is already present in the `Orb` or `OrbNode` classes does this force use?
  - YOUR ANSWER HERE

- Does this force require any new constants, if so what are they and what values will you try initially?
  - YOUR ANSWER HERE

- Does this force require any new information to be added to the `Orb` class? If so, what is it and what data type will you use?
  - YOUR ANSWER HERE

- Does this force interact with other `Orbs`, or is it applied based on the environment?
  - YOUR ANSWER HERE

- In order to calculate this force, do you need to perform extra intermediary calculations? If so, what?
